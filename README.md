## About Starry

"**Starry**" is the project’s name, and also my nickname. I’m a Chinese back-end developer with 5 years experience of full-time work. My English is not very good, please pardon me if I do something wrong ^_^

The project is designed by myself. At first, I just wanted to get a manageable thread pool to handle the infinite loop business. But then I found a light and stable ORM framework was more necessary in my daily work, so I decided to design a component which adjusting to my customs.Now the project has been released as v1.0.1-beta on nuget.org.

Although the first version is published, the project is still needed to improve. I hope there are someones who are interested in to help make it better. This is the reason why I opened the project.
