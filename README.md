## About Starry

"**Starry**" is the project's name, and also is my nickname. I'm a back-end developer with 5 years of full-time work experience. I worked in a Japanese company with 2 years, and in this time, I almost never use English, so it is the reason why my English is poor, if I have written something wrong with grammar, don't laugh at me please ^_^

This project is designed by only myself, at first I just want to get a manageable thread pool, use on the infinite loop business. but then I found in my daily working, a lightly and stable ORM framework is more necessary, so I decided to design a component conform to my habit.

Although the project is still on testing, I also hope it can works stable, so I hope there any more any more engineer can point out my shortages, not only the designed, even the naming, the comments, all of that I want to be better and better, this also the reason why I decided make this project open.
